# CS427 - Project
## *** Only supported on chrome or P5 web/desktop editor ***

This project have two parts
* Part 1: 
  * Shepard Tone Illusion Alram
* Part 2: 
  * Shepard Tone Keyboard/Piano
  
* I build this complete project on P5 web editor, so if you want to run the HTML you can download it and run it to the local server but, if you try to use the downloaded file without creating the local server. IT WON'T WORK!!
  * I will describe how to run the program below..
  
##  How to RUN the HTML 
There are two options to run the HTMLs files:
* Option 1: 
  * Just go on to the Hyperlinks provided below and play the projects.
    * [Part 1 - Shepard Tone Illusion Alram](https://editor.p5js.org/Hamzaimtiaz/sketches/KLEoa5MsO)
    * [Part 2 - Shepard Tone Keyboard/Piano](https://editor.p5js.org/Hamzaimtiaz/sketches/4q5idfDpo)

* Option 2:
  * Download this "Web Server for Chrome" if you want to run this HTML localy on Chrome. 
    * [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/)
    * ![Logo](/images/Chrome.png)
  * Once you have the Chrome application installed then just select the folder that you have already downloded from github and click on the "Web Server URL" after that you are in to the project directory. After that just click on 'Part1.html' or 'Part2.html' all up to you and it should work.
  
    * You can also go to the images folder and check out more pictures if you need more help with accessing the HTML files in Chrome.
  
## Thrid party libraries use
* As i said earlier on top that i did this full project on P5 web editor, so i had to use their [P5 libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/) in order to finish my project.
* [Refrences](https://p5js.org/)

## Thank You :)
